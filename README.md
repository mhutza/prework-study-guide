# prework-study-guide

## Description

My motivation for this project was to get a head start on the coding bootcamp and understand the learning strategy that is practiced. I built this project because I am dedicated to understand the processes of creation, collaboration, and ingenuity.
This guide solves the project I had of not understanding how to incorporate different coding languages into one giant piece, or project. It serves as a guide for the future.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
